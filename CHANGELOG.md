## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Theme engine** — full color theming from the admin dashboard
  - 7 preset themes: Default (blue), Nord (arctic frost), Dracula (dark purple), Gruvbox (retro warm), Solarized (classic), Tokyo Night (neon cityscape), Vates (Rouge & Bleu Spatial from official brand guidelines)
  - Custom theme: pick your own accent, accent hover, background, surface, and text colors via color pickers
  - Themes override all CSS custom properties (background, surface, text, accent, borders, success, error) for both light and dark modes
  - Served via `/accent.css` endpoint with 60s cache, cached in memory with `RwLock`
  - New migration: `theme`, `custom_accent`, `custom_accent_hover`, `custom_bg`, `custom_surface`, `custom_text` columns on `auth_config`
- **Dynamic timezone labels** — timezone picker shows UTC offsets computed at request time (DST-aware), e.g. "Paris, Brussels (UTC+1)"
- **Filled calendar grid** — previous and next month days fill empty calendar cells, clickable to navigate
- **Slot picker sidebar controls** — timezone selector and 12/24h toggle moved to left sidebar with "Your timezone" label
- **Floating theme toggle** — dark/light toggle as a floating button on the booking card

### Changed

- Replaced accent-only color swatches in admin with full theme card picker UI
- Removed redundant green availability dots from calendar days and slot pills

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Private event types** — mark any event type as "private" to hide it from your public profile and group pages. Private event types are only accessible via invite links.
- **Booking invites** — send personalized invite links for private event types
  - Invite management page at `/dashboard/invites/{event_type_id}` with sent invite list and status badges (active/expired/used)
  - Send invites with guest name, email, optional personal message, expiration (7/14/30 days or never), and single-use or multi-use toggle
  - Invite email sent via SMTP with indigo accent color, event details, and "Choose a time" CTA button
  - Tokenized URLs preserve the invite token through the full booking flow (slot picker → booking form → confirmation)
  - Guest name and email auto-filled from the invite data on the booking form
  - Token validated at every step: expired, used-up, or invalid tokens are rejected with a clear error
  - `used_count` incremented on successful booking
  - Works with both personal and group event types (round-robin assignment preserved)
  - Any user with dashboard access can create invites for private event types they can see (enables sales reps to invite guests to demo team event types)
  - New migration: `is_private` column on `event_types`, `booking_invites` table with token, expiration, usage tracking
- **Cal.com-style slot picker** — redesigned booking page with a 3-panel layout
  - Left sidebar with meeting info (host avatar, name, title, event details, duration, location)
  - Month calendar navigation (replaces week-by-week arrows)
  - Slot pills on the right, compact height for less scrolling
  - Responsive: stacks vertically on mobile
- **Reusable team links** — team links are now reusable by default (can be booked multiple times). Opt-in "one-time use" checkbox auto-deletes the link after a single booking. Existing one-time links are preserved via migration default.
- **Team link editing** — edit existing team links from the dashboard (title, duration, buffers, minimum notice, availability window, team members, one-time use toggle)
- **Dark/light theme toggle** — manual System/Light/Dark theme switcher
  - Public pages: sun/moon toggle in the footer, persisted in `localStorage`
  - Dashboard: appearance picker in Profile & Settings
  - Flash-free: inline `<head>` script applies theme before CSS loads
  - Defaults to system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- **Additional attendees** — guests can invite additional people to bookings
  - Configurable per event type: 0, 1, 3, 5, or 10 max additional guests
  - Dynamic email input rows with add/remove on the booking form
  - Additional attendees stored in `booking_attendees` table
  - ICS calendar invites include ATTENDEE lines for all guests
  - Confirmation emails sent to each additional attendee with ICS attachment
  - Shown on the confirmation page
  - New migration: `max_additional_guests` on event types, `booking_attendees` table

### Fixed

- **Stale cancelled events** — cancelling a booking in calrs now also removes the cached event from the local database, so it no longer blocks availability in troubleshoot or slot computation
- **Stale deleted events on sync** — full sync (`calrs sync --full`) now compares local events against the server and deletes orphans that were removed remotely
- **Hidden meeting details before booking** — video call links and phone numbers are no longer visible on the public slot picker page (only shown after booking)
- **24h time selects** — availability time inputs in event type and team link forms now use 24h select dropdowns instead of free-text input
- **XSS in team link form** — replaced `innerHTML` with DOM methods for user-supplied data in the member search UI

## [0.20.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Shared event visibility** — recurring events synced by multiple users (attendees of the same meeting) were invisible to some users' availability. The unique constraint on events was global instead of per-calendar, causing `ON CONFLICT` upserts to overwrite the `calendar_id` to whichever user synced last. Now each user's calendar gets its own copy of the event.

### Added

- **12/24h time format toggle** — slot pages show a 24h/12h toggle (default: 24h), persisted in `localStorage`. Applies to slot picker, booking form, and confirmation page.
- **Minimum notice unit selector** — event type and team link forms now show a number + unit dropdown (minutes/hours/days) instead of raw minutes. Auto-detects the best unit when editing.
- **Group event type management** — Edit, Disable/Enable, and Delete buttons for group event types ([#11](https://github.com/olivierlambert/calrs/issues/11)).

## [0.20.3] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Group event type management** — Edit, Disable/Enable, and Delete buttons for group event types on the dashboard ([#11](https://github.com/olivierlambert/calrs/issues/11)). Previously group event types could only be viewed, not managed after creation.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Slot ordering** — available time slots are now sorted by time within each day ([#10](https://github.com/olivierlambert/calrs/issues/10)). Previously, slots could appear out of order (e.g. afternoon before morning) when multiple availability windows were defined. Fixed in both web UI and CLI.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **Sidebar redesign** — calrs logo + two-tone brand name ("cal" blue, "rs" orange) at top linking to dashboard; user profile moved to bottom in a compact row with inline sign-out icon; clicking name/avatar goes to settings
- **Inter font** — loaded from Google Fonts for consistent typography across platforms
- **Admin pagination** — users and groups lists paginated (5 per page) with prev/next navigation
- **Admin search fields** — pill-shaped rounded inputs with accent focus ring
- **Stat card watermark icons** — faint centered emoji backgrounds (4% opacity) for visual personality
- **Welcome card accent** — 2px blue top border on the dashboard welcome card
- **Button gradient** — primary buttons use a subtle diagonal gradient instead of flat color
- **Pressed states** — buttons scale down (0.97×) on click for tactile feedback
- **Brand logo route** — `/brand-logo` serves the calrs logo (compiled into the binary)

### Fixed

- **Page flash removed** — removed the fade-in animation that caused a white flash on navigation
- **Footer overlap** — "Powered by calrs" no longer renders under the sidebar on dashboard pages; hidden on authenticated pages, shown only on public pages
- **Footer link** — "Powered by calrs" now links to cal.rs website instead of GitHub repo

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Clickable dashboard cards** — stat tiles (Event Types, Upcoming Bookings, Pending Approval, Calendar Sources) are now links to their respective dashboard pages
- **Public page link opens in new tab** — the `/u/{username}` link on the dashboard overview now opens in a new tab
- **Admin search/filter** — users list has a live filter by name or email; groups list has a live filter by name
- **Status badges** — "disabled" and "requires confirmation" on event types are now colored pill badges (red/amber) instead of plain text; pending bookings show an amber "pending" badge
- **Card hover lift** — interactive cards (stat tiles, profile event types, group event types) lift with a shadow on hover
- **Page fade-in animation** — subtle 0.3s fade-in + slide-up on every page load
- **Slot button hover scale** — time slot buttons scale up slightly (1.03×) on hover for a tactile feel
- **Colored left border** — event type cards on public profile and group pages have a 3px accent-colored left border
- **Profile gradient banner** — public profile page has a blue-to-purple gradient header behind the avatar
- **Animated checkmark** — confirmation page checkmark bounces in with a scale animation
- **Better empty states** — empty listings (bookings, event types, slots) show a larger icon + descriptive text instead of a plain line
- **Rust crab branding** — "Powered by calrs" footer now includes the 🦀 emoji on all pages

## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **Version link in sidebar** — calrs version in the dashboard sidebar now links to the GitHub release page for that version

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **CSRF protection** — double-submit cookie pattern on all 31 POST handlers via middleware
- **Booking rate limiting** — per-IP rate limiting (10 req / 5 min) on all booking endpoints using `X-Forwarded-For`
- **Input validation** — server-side validation on all booking forms (name 1–255, email format, notes max 5000, date max 365 days)
- **Double-booking prevention** — partial unique index on `(event_type_id, start_at)` + `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions
- **Crash-proof handlers** — all `.unwrap()` in web handlers replaced with proper error responses
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGINT/SIGTERM handling with `with_graceful_shutdown()` to drain in-flight requests
- **Structured logging** — 50 `tracing` log points across auth, bookings, CalDAV, admin, email, DB migrations. Configurable via `RUST_LOG` (default: `calrs=info,tower_http=info`)
- **HTTP request tracing** — `tower-http` TraceLayer logs every request with method, path, status, and latency
- **ICS attendee names** — calendar event SUMMARY now shows "{title} — {guest_first} & {host_first}" (e.g. "30min call — John & Olivier") instead of just the event type title
- **ICS guest notes** — guest notes included as DESCRIPTION field in ICS calendar events
- **Host confirmation email** — host receives a "Booking confirmed" email (without ICS attachment) after approving a pending booking. Previously only the guest was notified.
- **32 new tests** (191 → 223) covering ICS generation, input validation, CSRF functions, time extraction

### Fixed

- **ICS times at midnight on confirm/cancel** — `format_time_from_dt()` returned 12-hour display format ("2:00 PM") but `convert_to_utc()` expected 24-hour "HH:MM", causing all ICS events generated from database bookings (confirm, approve, cancel, decline, reminders) to have midnight times with zero duration. Added `extract_time_24h()` helper.
- **Missing host email on booking approval** — both `confirm_booking` (dashboard) and `approve_booking_by_token` (email link) only sent the guest a confirmation email, never notifying the host.
- **Silent email failures** — `send_host_notification` errors were discarded via `let _ =`. Now logged at error level with the target email address.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **ICS location field corruption** — LOCATION line in `.ics` calendar invites had trailing whitespace after CRLF, causing the ORGANIZER field to be interpreted as a continuation of LOCATION per RFC 5545 line folding rules. BlueMind and other strict CalDAV servers displayed the organizer info inside the location field.
- **ICS floating times** — DTSTART/DTEND in `.ics` invites used floating times (no timezone) instead of UTC. Events appeared at the wrong time for guests in different timezones. Now converts to UTC with `Z` suffix via `convert_to_utc()`.
- **Hardcoded UTC guest timezone** — `confirm_booking` and `approve_booking_by_token` handlers passed `"UTC"` as guest timezone instead of the actual stored timezone, causing ICS times in approval emails to be wrong.
- **Broken "Add source" link on dashboard overview** — pointed to `/dashboard/sources/add` instead of `/dashboard/sources/new`

### Added

- **Version display in sidebar** — calrs version shown at the bottom of the dashboard sidebar

## [0.18.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Calendar reminders via VALARM** — booking ICS events now include a native calendar reminder (DISPLAY alarm) when the event type has `reminder_minutes` configured. The calendar app shows a popup notification before the meeting, working offline without SMTP. Applies to both email .ics attachments and CalDAV write-back. Closes #4.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Multiple availability windows per event type** — define separate time blocks (e.g. 09:00–12:00 + 13:00–17:00) to create lunch breaks or custom schedules. Dynamic "Add time window" UI with add/remove buttons. Backward-compatible with existing single-window event types. Closes #5.

### Fixed

- **Post-action redirects go to correct dashboard page** — creating/deleting team links, event types, bookings, and sources now redirect to their respective page instead of the overview

## [0.17.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Post-action redirects go to correct dashboard page** — creating/deleting team links now redirects to `/dashboard/team-links` instead of the overview; same fix applied to event types (`/dashboard/event-types`), bookings (`/dashboard/bookings`), and sources (`/dashboard/sources`)

## [0.17.5] - 2026-03-11

### Improved

- **Test coverage** — added 35 tests for date formatting helpers, email HTML rendering, ICS generation (including injection prevention), and timezone parsing. Total: 147 → 182 tests.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Team link creation "duplicate field" error** — switched to `axum_extra::extract::Form` (serde_html_form) for team link handler, since HTML checkboxes with the same name produce repeated keys that `serde_urlencoded` rejects

## [0.17.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Raw dates on token-based booking pages** — approve, decline, cancel confirmation and form pages now show human-friendly dates (e.g. "Saturday, March 15, 2026") instead of raw ISO8601 strings
- **Raw dates in reminder and cancellation emails** — time formatting now correctly parses both `T` and space datetime separators from the database

## [0.17.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Team link creation fails with single day selected** — form deserialization now handles HTML checkboxes sending a single string instead of a sequence when only one checkbox is checked
- **Mobile responsiveness** — booking rows, event type listings, and form grids now stack vertically on small screens; reduced padding on mobile; cancel form input uses responsive width

### Improved

- **Human-friendly booking dates** — dashboard bookings now show "Today at 2:30 PM — 3:00 PM", "Tomorrow at 10:00 AM — 10:30 AM", "Wednesday at 3:00 PM", etc. instead of raw ISO8601 timestamps

## [0.17.1] - 2026-03-11

### Improved

- **Host identity on booking pages** — slots page now shows host avatar, name, and title above the event type card (individual bookings only; group/team links show host name in the meta line)
- **Team link member search** — replaced checkbox list with a search bar + pill selection UX; type to filter users by name or email, click to add as a pill, remove with X; avatars shown in search results
- **Matrix-style initials** — avatar fallback now uses two-letter initials (first letter of first name + first letter of last name, e.g. "OL" for Olivier Lambert) across sidebar, settings, public profile, and booking pages
- **Onboarding hero block** — dashboard overview shows a prominent CTA card when no calendar sources exist, guiding users to add their first source

### Fixed

- Team link form validation errors now re-fetch the user list instead of showing an empty form

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Sidebar navigation** — persistent left sidebar on all authenticated pages
  - Organized nav sections: Scheduling (Overview, Event Types, Bookings, Team Links), Calendars (Sources), Personal (Profile & Settings, Troubleshoot), Admin (admin-only)

  - `/dashboard/event-types` — Personal and group event types with create/edit/toggle/delete
  - `/dashboard/bookings` — Pending approval and upcoming bookings
  - `/dashboard/sources` — Calendar sources with sync/test/remove/write-back
  - `/dashboard/team-links` — Team links with copy link/view/delete
  - All sub-pages (event type form, source form, troubleshoot, admin, etc.) now render with sidebar

- **Ad-hoc team links** — create shareable booking links across hand-picked calrs users, without needing admin-managed groups
  - Pick any combination of calrs users as team members from the dashboard
  - Slot availability requires ALL selected members to be free simultaneously
  - Configurable duration, buffer times, minimum notice, and availability window (days + hours)
  - Public booking URL at `/t/{token}` — no authentication required for guests
  - CalDAV write-back to every member's calendar on booking
  - Email notifications sent to all members and the guest
  - One-time use: link auto-deleted after a successful booking
  - Team links section on the dashboard with copy link, view, and delete actions
  - `BusySource::Team` variant in the availability engine (ALL must be free, vs Group's ANY)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Booking reminders** — automated email reminders sent to both guest and host before upcoming meetings
  - Configurable per event type: no reminder, 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, or 2 days before
  - Default for new event types: 1 day before
  - Background task runs every 60 seconds inside `calrs serve`, no external cron needed
  - Guest reminder includes a "Cancel booking" button (if `CALRS_BASE_URL` is set)
  - Host reminder includes guest name and meeting details
  - `reminder_sent_at` tracked on each booking to prevent duplicate sends
  - Catches up on missed reminders after server restart
  - Blue accent color (#3b82f6) to distinguish from confirmation (green) and cancellation (red) emails

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Guest self-cancellation** — guests can cancel their own bookings via a token-based link, without logging in
  - New `GET/POST /booking/cancel/{cancel_token}` public endpoints (same pattern as approve/decline)
  - Cancel form shows booking details and an optional reason textarea
  - On cancellation: booking status set to `cancelled`, CalDAV event deleted, both guest and host notified by email
  - Confirmation and pending emails now include a "Cancel booking" button linking to the cancel page
  - Requires `CALRS_BASE_URL` environment variable to generate cancel URLs
  - Graceful handling of already-cancelled, declined, or invalid tokens

### Fixed

- **Cancellation email attribution** — when the host cancels a booking from the dashboard, the host notification email no longer incorrectly says the guest cancelled; emails now correctly attribute who initiated the cancellation

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-10

  - New "Calendars" section on the event type form with checkboxes for all `is_busy=1` calendars
  - Junction table `event_type_calendars` links event types to selected calendars
  - If no calendars are selected, all busy calendars are checked (fully backward-compatible)
  - Filter applied across all availability paths: web slot picker, booking validation, group scheduling, troubleshoot page, and CLI commands
  - Cascade delete: removing a calendar source automatically cleans up junction rows

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **AES-256-GCM encryption for stored credentials** — CalDAV and SMTP passwords encrypted at rest
  - Secret key auto-generated at `$DATA_DIR/secret.key` or provided via `CALRS_SECRET_KEY` env var
  - Legacy hex-encoded passwords auto-migrated on startup
  - Hidden password input via `rpassword`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Timezone-aware CalDAV event handling** — CalDAV events now carry their original timezone through sync, storage, and availability computation
  - New `extract_vevent_tzid()` extracts TZID from iCal DTSTART/DTEND lines (e.g., `DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Paris:...` → `Europe/Paris`, trailing `Z` → `UTC`, no TZID → floating/local)
  - New `convert_event_to_tz()` converts event times from their stored timezone to the host's timezone before busy-time overlap checks
  - `events.timezone` column (already existed but was never populated) is now set during both CLI and web sync
  - All availability computations (slot picker, booking conflict checks, group scheduling, troubleshoot timeline) convert event times to the host's timezone
  - Pre-existing events with `timezone = NULL` are treated as floating (host-local) — fully backward-compatible
  - Invalid or unrecognized TZID strings gracefully degrade to floating (no conversion)
  - All-day events pass through unchanged (no timezone applies)
  - RRULE expansion still happens in the event's own timezone, conversion applied after — correct across DST transitions

### Fixed

- **Cross-timezone availability miscalculation** — an event at 10:00 America/New_York now correctly blocks 16:00 for a Europe/Paris host, instead of incorrectly blocking 10:00

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Email approve/decline for pending bookings** — host notification emails now include "Approve" and "Decline" buttons that work without logging in
  - Token-based authentication via `confirm_token` on each booking
  - Approve: confirms the booking, pushes to CalDAV, sends guest confirmation email
  - Decline: shows a form for an optional reason, notifies the guest by email
  - Requires `CALRS_BASE_URL` environment variable to generate action URLs
  - Graceful handling of already-processed bookings (already approved, declined, or cancelled)

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **Multi-VEVENT CalDAV sync** — recurring events with modified instances (RECURRENCE-ID) are now split and stored as separate rows during sync, so modified occurrences correctly block or free availability
  - BlueMind bundles the parent VEVENT (with RRULE) and modified instances in a single CalDAV resource; the sync now splits them using `split_vevents()`
  - New unique index `(uid, COALESCE(recurrence_id, ''))` allows parent and modified instances to coexist
  - Fixed both CLI sync and **web dashboard sync** (which was still using the old single-VEVENT logic)
  - Migration 009 was not registered in `db.rs` — now properly included

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **HTML email notifications** — all booking emails now use a clean, responsive HTML design with a plain text fallback
  - Color-coded accent bar: green (confirmed), amber (pending/approval), red (cancelled)
  - Structured detail table with event, date, time, guest/host info
  - Proper HTML escaping for all user-supplied values
  - `MultiPart::alternative` ensures clients without HTML support get the plain text version

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **User-scoped availability on public pages** — public booking pages (`/u/{username}/{slug}` and legacy `/:slug`) incorrectly used global busy times (all users' events) instead of the host user's events only, causing other users' calendar events to block the host's available slots
- **Group slot fallback** — the group event type slot page fallback also used global busy times; now correctly scoped to the event type owner
- **Removed dead code** — `fetch_busy_times_global()` removed since all paths now use `fetch_busy_times_for_user()`



### Added

- **Admin impersonation** — admins can impersonate any user from the admin dashboard to troubleshoot their configuration (Closes #7)
  - "Impersonate" button on each user row in the admin dashboard
  - Amber banner at the top of all pages while impersonating, showing who is being impersonated
  - "Stop impersonating" button to return to the admin's own session
  - Cookie-based implementation (`calrs_impersonate`), 24-hour expiry, HttpOnly + Secure
  - Admin pages remain accessible while impersonating (uses real session, not impersonated user)
  - Dashboard shows the impersonated user's event types, bookings, and calendar sources

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **Internal refactoring** — extracted shared busy-time helpers (`fetch_busy_times_global`, `fetch_busy_times_for_user`, `has_conflict`, `BusySource`) eliminating ~300 lines of duplicated availability queries across booking handlers, slot computation, and group scheduling
- **Unified slot computation** — `compute_slots` now serves both individual and group event types via a `BusySource` enum, replacing the separate `compute_group_slots` function
- **Extracted `prompt()` utility** — consolidated 4 duplicate CLI prompt functions into `src/utils.rs`

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **RECURRENCE-ID handling** — modified instances of recurring events (e.g., a single occurrence moved to a different time) are now properly excluded from RRULE expansion, preventing phantom duplicate occurrences in availability checks
- **Daily COUNT bug** — `FREQ=DAILY` events with `COUNT` now correctly count all occurrences from the event start, not just those within the query window; previously a COUNT-limited daily event could produce more total occurrences than intended
- **Cancelled events ignored** — events with `STATUS:CANCELLED` in the CalDAV calendar are now excluded from all availability checks (previously they still blocked time slots)
- **RECURRENCE-ID stored during sync** — the `recurrence_id` field is now extracted from iCal data and stored in the events table (migration 008)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **RRULE expansion** — recurring calendar events now correctly block booking availability
  - Supports FREQ=DAILY, FREQ=WEEKLY (with BYDAY), FREQ=MONTHLY (with Nth weekday BYDAY like 2MO, -1FR)
  - Handles INTERVAL, UNTIL, COUNT, and EXDATE
  - Integrated across all availability checks: public slot picker, CLI slots, booking creation validation, troubleshoot page, and group member availability
- **Availability troubleshoot page** — visual timeline at `/dashboard/troubleshoot` showing why slots are available or blocked
  - Color-coded blocks: green (available), red (calendar event), orange (booking), gray (outside hours), striped (buffer/min notice)
  - Blocked slots breakdown with event names and calendar sources
  - Event type and date selector with prev/next day navigation

### Fixed

- **Recurring events with compact date format** — events stored in iCal compact format (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS`) were not found by queries comparing against ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) due to string comparison; now queries compare against both formats
- **Duplicate guest emails** — guest confirmation emails used `METHOD:REQUEST` in the `.ics` attachment, causing mail servers like BlueMind to send an additional calendar invitation; changed to `METHOD:PUBLISH` (Closes #6)
- **Missing availability rules message** — troubleshoot page now shows "No availability rules for this day" instead of the misleading "All times are bookable" when no rules exist for the selected weekday

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-09

### Security

- **Login rate limiting** — 10 attempts per IP per 15-minute window, using `X-Forwarded-For` from reverse proxy
- **Secure cookie flag** — all session and OIDC cookies now include `Secure` (HTTPS-only)
- **ICS injection protection** — user-supplied values in `.ics` invites are sanitized (CR/LF stripped, special chars escaped per RFC 5545)
- **Security documentation** — new `docs/src/security.md` covering all security measures and known limitations

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **CalDAV write-back** — confirmed bookings are automatically pushed to the host's CalDAV calendar via PUT, and deleted on cancellation via DELETE
  - New `put_event()` and `delete_event()` methods on the CalDAV client
  - Per-source "Write bookings to" calendar selector on the dashboard
  - Bookings track which calendar they were pushed to (`caldav_calendar_href`) for accurate deletion
  - Works for individual bookings, group round-robin bookings, and pending-then-confirmed bookings
  - No configuration needed if you don't want write-back — skipped silently when no write calendar is set

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Dockerfile** — multi-stage build (rust:bookworm builder, debian:bookworm-slim runtime), runs as unprivileged `calrs` user
- **`.dockerignore`** — keeps build context clean
- **systemd service file** (`calrs.service`) — production-ready unit with `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`, and other hardening directives
- **Install section in README** — Docker, Docker Compose, binary + systemd, and from-source instructions

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Calendar source management from the web dashboard** — add, test, sync, and remove CalDAV sources without the CLI
  - Provider selector with presets: BlueMind, Nextcloud, Fastmail, iCloud, Google, Zimbra, SOGo, Radicale
  - Auto-fills CalDAV URL and display name when selecting a provider
  - Contextual help per provider (app passwords, skip-test tips, URL patterns)
  - Connection test before saving (with "skip test" option for tricky servers)
  - One-click sync from the dashboard (full CalDAV discovery + event fetch)
  - Connection test button to verify credentials
  - Remove with confirmation dialog (cascade-deletes calendars and events)
- **Dashboard "Calendar sources" card** — lists all connected sources with URL, username, last sync time, and action buttons

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Group event types** — create event types owned by a group (synced from Keycloak)
  - Combined availability: slot picker shows times where any group member is free
  - Round-robin assignment: bookings assigned to the least-busy available member
  - Public group pages at `/g/{group-slug}` and `/g/{group-slug}/{slug}`
  - Group selector when creating event types from the dashboard
- **Timezone support** — guest timezone picker on slot pages
  - Browser timezone auto-detected via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
  - Times displayed and booked in the guest's selected timezone
  - Timezone preserved across navigation (week picker, booking form)
- Project logo

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **OIDC group sync** — groups synced from Keycloak `groups` JWT claim on each SSO login
- **Groups in admin dashboard** — group names, member counts, and per-user group badges
- Leading `/` stripped from Keycloak group paths for cleaner display

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **OIDC authentication** — OpenID Connect SSO via Keycloak (authorization code flow with PKCE, auto-discovery, user linking by email, auto-registration)
- **Admin dashboard** at `/dashboard/admin` — user management (promote/demote, enable/disable), auth settings (registration, domain restrictions), OIDC config, SMTP status
- **Event type management UI** — create/edit event types from the web dashboard with availability schedule, location, and confirmation toggle
- **Location support** — video link, phone, in-person, or custom location on event types; displayed on public pages, emails, and `.ics` invites
- **OIDC CLI configuration** — `calrs config oidc` with interactive and flag-based modes

### Fixed

- Multiple `Set-Cookie` headers in OIDC flow (using `HeaderMap::append` instead of array tuples)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Local authentication** — email/password login with Argon2 hashing, server-side sessions (30-day TTL, HttpOnly cookies)
- **User roles** — admin/user with extractors (`AuthUser`, `AdminUser`)
- **User management CLI** — `calrs user create/list/promote/demote/set-password`
- **Registration controls** — `calrs config auth` to enable/disable registration and restrict by email domain
- **User-scoped URLs** — public booking pages at `/u/{username}/{slug}`, profile pages at `/u/{username}`
- **Booking cancellation** — cancel from dashboard with optional reason, email notifications with `.ics` METHOD:CANCEL
- **Pending bookings** — event types with `requires_confirmation`; host approves/declines from dashboard
- **Web dashboard** — event types, pending approvals, upcoming bookings

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Web booking page** — `calrs serve` starts an Axum HTTP server with a full booking flow:
  - `GET /:slug` — public page showing available time slots for an event type
  - `GET /:slug/book?date=&time=` — booking form with name, email, and notes
  - `POST /:slug/book` — submits the booking with conflict detection, min-notice validation, and email notifications
  - Confirmation page with booking summary
- **`calrs serve [--port 3000]`** — new CLI command to start the web server
- **Minijinja templates** — clean, responsive HTML templates (base, slots, book, confirmed) with no JavaScript dependencies
- **Server-side slot computation** — reuses the same availability engine as the CLI (availability rules, buffer times, busy events, confirmed bookings)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Email notifications on booking** — when a booking is created, both the guest and the host receive an email with a `.ics` calendar invite attached (METHOD:REQUEST)
- **SMTP configuration** (`calrs config smtp`) — configure SMTP server, credentials, and sender identity. Stored in SQLite
- **`calrs config show`** — display current SMTP configuration
- **`calrs config smtp-test <email>`** — send a test email to verify SMTP setup
- **`smtp_config` table** — new migration table for SMTP settings (one per account)

### Notes

- If no SMTP is configured, bookings still work — emails are simply skipped
- Tested with Scaleway Transactional Email (SWG) on port 2525 with STARTTLS

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`calrs booking create <slug>`** — book a slot with full validation: minimum notice, availability rules, conflict detection against both calendar events and existing bookings
- **Booking conflict detection in slots** — `calrs event-type slots` now excludes times blocked by confirmed bookings (not just calendar events)
- **README: "Connecting your calendar" section** — CalDAV URL reference table for Nextcloud, BlueMind, Fastmail, iCloud, Google, Zimbra, SOGo, Radicale with examples

### Fixed

- **Availability engine date comparison** — properly parse iCal compact dates (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS`) and ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) into `NaiveDateTime` for accurate conflict detection, instead of broken string comparison across formats

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- **CalDAV discovery** — proper two-step discovery: principal URL → calendar-home-set → calendar listing. Previously grabbed the first `<d:href>` instead of the one inside `<d:current-user-principal>`
- **Calendar filtering** — only sync actual `<cal:calendar/>` collections, skip inbox, outbox, notifications, freebusy, and task lists
- **URL resolution** — absolute paths from the server (e.g. `/dav/calendars/...`) are now resolved against the server origin, not appended to the base URL (which caused doubled paths like `/dav/dav`)
- **iCal date parsing** — extract DTSTART/DTEND from the VEVENT block only, ignoring VTIMEZONE entries that produced incorrect 1970 dates
- **Date format handling** — calendar show now handles both `YYYYMMDD` (iCal all-day) and `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` formats, with proper display formatting
- **XML tag parsing** — handle tags with attributes (e.g. `<aic:calendar-color symbolic-color="custom">`) and BlueMind-specific namespace prefixes (`aic:`, `cso:`)

### Added

- **`--no-test` flag** on `calrs source add` to skip the OPTIONS connection test (needed for servers like BlueMind that don't respond to OPTIONS)
- **10-second HTTP timeout** on all CalDAV requests (60s for event fetches) to prevent infinite hangs
- **calendar-home-set discovery** step in CalDAV client (`discover_calendar_home()`)

### Tested

- Successfully syncs with **BlueMind** CalDAV (4332 events, all-day and timed)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-09

Initial development release. CLI-only, no web interface yet.

### Added

- **Account setup** (`calrs init`) — interactive first-time configuration with name, email, and timezone
- **CalDAV source management** (`calrs source add/list/remove/test`) — connect CalDAV servers (Nextcloud, Fastmail, iCloud, etc.), test connections, hex-encoded credential storage
- **Calendar sync** (`calrs sync`) — pull events from all CalDAV sources via PROPFIND/REPORT, upsert into local SQLite
- **Calendar viewer** (`calrs calendar show`) — display synced events in a table with date range filtering
- **Event types** (`calrs event-type create/list/slots`) — define bookable meeting templates with duration, buffers, and minimum notice. Default Mon–Fri 09:00–17:00 availability rules
- **Availability engine** — compute free slots by intersecting availability rules with synced busy events
- **Booking management** (`calrs booking list/cancel`) — view and cancel bookings
- **SQLite storage** — WAL mode, foreign keys with CASCADE, indexed queries
- **CalDAV client** — minimal RFC 4791 implementation: OPTIONS check, principal discovery, calendar listing, VEVENT fetch
